# Natural Language Processing with Keras NLP and Hugging Face

This repository contains implementations of various NLP tasks using Keras NLP and Hugging Face libraries. The project demonstrates fundamental NLP concepts and techniques through practical examples organized into interactive Colab notebooks.

## Project Overview

This assignment explores three key NLP patterns:
1. **Inference with Pretrained Classifiers**: Leveraging existing models for text generation and classification tasks
2. **Fine-tuning Pretrained Backbones**: Adapting pre-existing models for specific NLP tasks
3. **Building Transformers from Scratch**: Implementing transformer architecture for text classification

## Colab Notebooks
